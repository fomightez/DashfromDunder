This fork of [the official repository for 'Python data science and machine learning from Ted Petrou with Dunder Data'](https://github.com/DunderData/Tutorials) was set up to see if I can change a few things to restore it working with the MyBinder system to see if Plotly Dash app it has maybe can be made to continue working via MyBinder. (This is the most current example I found so far of using Dash with MyBinder?!?! old: https://github.com/plotly/jupyterlab-dash/issues/14 & https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/jupyterlab-dash-needs-to-be-included-in-built-on-binder/14164 )  
Please see [the official repository](https://github.com/DunderData/Tutorials) for more information about the tutorials.  


# Tutorials

This repository contains various tutorials on python, data science, and machine learning within Jupyter Notebooks written by Ted Petrou with [Dunder Data][0].

## Completing the Tutorials

Get started working on these tutorials immediately by launching a remote Jupyter Notebook by clicking the following link courtesy of Binder.
